#+title: Calypso (Client for [[https://github.com/tell396/kinoway][Kinoway]])

This is a [[https://nextjs.org/][Next.js]] project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

** Getting Started

First, run the development server:

#+begin_src bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
#+end_src

Open [[http://localhost:3000]] with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[[https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction][API routes]] can be accessed on [[http://localhost:3000/api/hello]]. This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [[https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction][API routes]] instead of React pages.
